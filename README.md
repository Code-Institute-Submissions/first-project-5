#  First Project
##  Keebs Fitness

In this project I tried to create a website for a fitness center owned by a group of friends how are looking to expand their current share of the market.

This is an all female business venturing into the world of a male dominated industry. 

#  UX

This website is targeted to people who are looking to get into fitness. It targets a wide range of age group from the teenagers to pensioners.

I wanted to ensure that when a user clicks on the website, they should be able to find the location of the gym, any special promotions that were on ofer, the opening times and also to realise that they were in the right place for their fitness need. I provided easy to sign up link on very page to ensure esay access to for new customers to do so online.
